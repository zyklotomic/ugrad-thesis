For this section, we will refer to the \texttt{io\_uring} case interchangeably as the \texttt{URingManager} case, and likewise for epoll being interchangeable with \texttt{EventManager}.

In the single-Capability case, with 50 concurrent connections, and \texttt{URingManager} at 4028 kilobytes per second vs. \texttt{EventManager} at 3923 kilobytes per second, \texttt{io\_uring} has a very negligible lead in throughput over epoll. However, \texttt{io\_uring} performance worsens as the Capability count increases. As for \texttt{EventManager}, throughput increases slightly as Capability count increases up until it plateaus at around 6 Capabilities. These observations
regarding throughput can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:throughput}.

As for tail latency, the single core \texttt{io\_uring} case is comparable to
\texttt{epoll} as shown in the Cumulative Fraction graphs.
Like with throughput, tail latency is worse as the number of URingManager capabilities increase;
compare Figure \ref{fig:epoll_latency} and \ref{fig:uring_latency}.
